## 👩‍💻 About Me

With over **10 years of experience** in operations, purchasing, inventory management and customer success — mainly in the **retail and luxury** industries — I’ve recently transitioned into the **data world** to bring a more strategic and analytical dimension to my work.

🛠️ I’m currently improving my skills in:

- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL**
- **Power BI & Tableau**
- **Excel Advanced**
- Data cleaning, visualization & storytelling

My past experience allows me to understand business needs, coordinate with multiple teams, and now transform data into insights that support real-world decision-making.
